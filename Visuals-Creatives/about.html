    <h2>My Background Story</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate and multi-skilled creative with a Diploma in Applied Statistics and a strong foundation in data analysis, web development, graphic design, and video editing. 
      My academic background has equipped me with analytical thinking, precision, and problem-solving skills, which I apply across both technical and creative projects. 
      I thrive in dynamic environments where I can transform data into actionable insights, design compelling visual content, and build functional digital platforms.</p>
    <p>My professional journey began with a 6-month experience as an Office Administrator Assistant at the County Government of Makueni, where I gained hands-on exposure to administrative operations, data entry, and customer service. 
      This role sharpened my organizational and communication skills, while giving me a deeper understanding of public service and operational coordination. 
      Since then, I have continued to expand my capabilities by working on personal projects that blend statistical knowledge with digital creativity.</p>
    <p>Driven by curiosity and a desire to create impact, I have developed and designed a personal portfolio website — Visuals Creatives — to showcase my projects in data analysis, web and graphic design, and video editing. 
      I am actively seeking both online and physical opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully, grow professionally, and gain financial independence. 
      With a commitment to continuous learning and a versatile skill set, I am ready to take on new challenges and deliver value in any role I pursue.</p>
    <p>At Visuals Creatives, we are more than just a design agency; we are storytellers, innovators, and problem solvers. Our background story is one of passion, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of excellence in everything we do.</p>
